                            I am David Ceresuela, a Computer Engineer living in Zaragoza, Spain. I have just finished my master thesis and I am quite happy about it. When I am not in front of the computer I am probably playing the guitar or reading a book. A year ago, tired of being sluggish I started running. It is also tiring, but feels better.
